# Here goes nothing!

Welcome to my first attempt at a NodeJS server and SQLite database built from scratch!

*What am I doing you may be asking?*

Now **THAT** is a great question! Because I certainly do not know either.

I am trying freshen up my skills on many things:
- Creating a fresh project from scratch
- Setting up that scratch project as a git repository
- Successfully building a Node server with routes using Express
- Building out data tables with SQLite3 && Knex

Look, I am on about my 6th? Cup of coffee today.. Give me a break! :D

I will, in fact, be very surprised, if I complete this successfully.

`Plus`, writing in markdown is fun... I mean **LOOK AT THIS!**
